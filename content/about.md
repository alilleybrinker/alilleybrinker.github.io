I&rsquo;m a Principal Engineer at [MITRE][mitre], where I&hellip;

Lead the development of [Hipcheck][hipcheck], a tool to empower open source
maintainers and users to assess the supply chain risk of their dependencies.

Serve as a member of the [OmniBOR Core Team][omnibor], including leading
creation of the [Rust library and `omnibor` CLI][omnibor-rs].

## Where to Find Me

[GitHub] &middot; [Bluesky] &middot; [Mastodon] &middot;
[LinkedIn] &middot; [Hacker News] &middot; [Lobste.rs] &middot; [Reddit]

I still maintain a [Twitter / X] account because I sometimes need to be able
to read things there, and I do not want to risk my old account being claimed
by someone else.

### Getting in Touch

I don't check every platform equally often. If you want to get in touch, the
best way to do it is to direct message me on [Bluesky].

If you want to chat securely, ask me for my Signal username.

## AI Policy

The words on this site were written by a human (Andrew) with care.
If AI content _is_ ever posted to this site, it will always be made

[This statement was inspired by Adam Chalmers](https://hachyderm.io/@alilleybrinker/113075373305316141).

## My Name

"Lilley Brinker" is my full last name. Two parts, no hyphen. When my wife and I
got married we combined our last names without a hyphen. My last name is not
"Brinker" and it is not correct to call me "Mr. Brinker".

"Lilley" is pronounced like the word "lily".
