I'm a bit late to sharing it here, but [an article of mine][article] was in the
November issue of the ACM Queue! Called ["Memory Safety for Skeptics,"][article]
it argues for why memory safety is worth pursuing amid competing priorities. It
was a lot of fun to write, and is purposefully _not_ an article about rewriting
codebases in Rust. Check it out!
