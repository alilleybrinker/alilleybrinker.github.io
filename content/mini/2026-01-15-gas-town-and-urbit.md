Yesterday I wrote ["Gas Town Decoded,"][decoded] a brief guide to the insular
language Steve Yegge uses to describe [Gas Town][welcome]. Gas Town, for those
out of the loop, is Yegge's attempt to build a system for AI agent
orchestration.

Today, Steve _Klabnik_ wrote ["How to think about Gas Town,"][think] which
analyzes why Gas Town chose to use such strange language in the first place.
It's a great piece, and one with which I agree. You should read it!

In discussions around Gas Town, I and many others have noted the parallels to
another infamous software system that used insular language: Urbit.

While it's true that both Gas Town and Urbit invent their own language
specific to their projects, they are otherwise _extremely_ different. Urbit
is fascist, Gas Town is not.

As Klabnik describes in his piece, Gas Town's insular language is used by
Yegge to signpost the experimental nature of the project and to discourage
production use. Klabnik argues Yegge did this because, as someone who is
programmer-famous, he knows anything he works on will be taken seriously by
others.

Urbit, on the other hand, used insular language to create a sense of
exclusivity and complexity, as part of Curtis Yarvin's attempt to gain an
audience for his fascist political ideas. Throughout the 2010's, Yarvin
leveraged Urbit to gain entry to programmer forums and conferences, where he
could then spread his politics alongside his software.

So, while it's true both Gas Town and Urbit use insular language, we shouldn't
consider them similar beyond that.
