\"what happens\nnext\" to split. In structured programming this would generally come in the form of\na series of if/else if/else (or whatever the syntax is in your preferred language),\nor a switch if your language supports it. Maybe you have a ternary operator for a more\ncompact if/else. Maybe you go whole-hog and have some array of function pointers\nto embed the selection into data. Whatever way you slice it, you have paths of control\nflow, and you want to choose between them in a structured fashion.\nAnother way to enable this kind of selection is through the use of polymorphism. In an\nObject-Oriented framing, this might mean subtype polymorphism via the use of child classes\nof some shared parent class. This notion is in some way an extension of the \"array of\nfunction pointers\" approach, except instead of an explicit array of function pointers like\nyou might find in C, you instead have, for each object, an implicit set of function pointers\nfor the method implementations in each subclass, and the language dispatches to those\nbased on the concrete type being handled.\nDepending on the language, the nature of overriding, method lookup, etc. may differ, but the\ngeneral notion is the same. Objects have some associated set of functions to which function\ncalls in the caller are dispatched according to the concrete type. We've elevated\nimplementation from the value level to the type level. This is convenient!\nIn Rust, my own preferred language, you have instead a nice little grid of four options\nfor \"implementation selection,\" which vary based on whether dispatch is done at compile\ntime or run time, and whether the set of types which may be used is \"open\" (meaning\nthird-parties can use their own types) or \"closed\" (meaning only the types intended by the\noriginal creator may be used).\nResolved at compile timeResolved at runtime\nOpen set of typesGenerics params with traitTrait objects\nClosed set of typesGeneric params with sealed traitsEnum\n\nLet's cover each of these in turn:\n1. Generic Parameters with Traits\nThis is Rust's standard mechanism for parametric polymorphism. You have a generic function,\nwith the generic type bounded by some trait(s). In this case, the calls to the generic\nfunction are resolved at compile time, meaning the generic function is monomorphized to produce\na non-generic copy of it specialized for each concrete type the function is called with,\nand the newly-generated concrete functions are swapped in for the generic function at the callsite.\nThis gives you fast run time behavior (no dispatching / pointer chasing to do), but you\nspend a bit more time on code generation during compilation, and the object file size generally\ngets bigger. It also limits separate compilation, because the generic code needs to know the\nconcrete type(s) it's getting called with.\nYou also, crucially, don't control the types which can be passed to the generic function. In\nthis category, the trait(s) involved are public, so third-parties can implement them for their\nown types. This is usually desirable, as it lets you write flexible APIs that expand to fit\nfuture needs or the needs of others which you can't predict.\n2. Generic Parameters with Sealed Traits\nIn this quadrant, the trade-offs are the same as for generics with unsealed traits, with the\nexception that you've now limited the set of types to be \"closed.\" So now, the only types\nwhich can be passed to the generic function are your own types which have implemented the\nrelevant trait.\nThis lets you have the benefits of generics in your own code without exposing a generic API\nyou don't actually intend to be generic.\nOn the other hand, consumers of your code may be put off by seeing a generic mechanism which\nthey can't actually use (we often want whatever we can't have), and it also means more complex\nfunction signatures versus manually (or with the help of macros) writing out each version of\nthe function for the concrete types by hand.\n3. Trait Objects\nTrait objects work like generic parameters with traits, in that a function can be polymorphic\nover the concrete type they're handling, but it moves function dispatch from compile time to\nrun time. There are some limitations here, namely that not all traits in Rust can be made into\ntrait objects (this limitation is based on \"object safety,\" and the specific rules basically\ncodify that only traits whose dispatch can be handled at run time can be made into trait\nobjects).\nTrait objects are powerful, and I've actually written about them before. On Possible Rust I\nwrite \"3 Things to Try When You Can't Make a Trait Object,\". Looking back\nat that article now, I realize the first two suggestions are literally suggestions to move\non step in either direction on the grid I shared at the start of this article. Option 1 is\n\"Try an enum\" (meaning close the set of types which is currently open), Option 2 is\n\"try type erasure\" (meaning use a trick from David Tolnay to span a non-object safe trait\ninto an object-safe equivalent trait so you can make a trait object). So option 1 is\nabout moving down one in the quadrant, and option 2 is about moving to the left.\nAt any rate, trait objects are great, and powerful, though you pay a cost with run time\ndispatch. You should benchmark and see if that cost is relevant for you.\n4. Enumerations\nFinally, enums, one of Rust's most powerful features. Enums let you list a set of\ndata-carrying variants, one of which will be present at runtime. Then, when using\nthe enum type, you match (or use a match-equivalent) to select the right behavior.\nThis is, conceptually, similar to the good-old if/else if/else chaining, or to\nswitch, but with the added benefit of exhaustiveness checking. The compiler makes sure\nyou cover all possible variants of the enum when selecting the right behavior, so you\ndon't miss any possibilities.\nConclusion\nNothing said in this post is revelatory, but hopefully it provides a helpful description\nof the option space here when you want to be able to have some \"implementation selection\"\nin your program.

It was originally published on\nDecember 3rd, 2016.\n\n\nIn this post I will discuss monomorphization: what it is, why it's useful, and\nwhat problems can potentially arise from it, with a particular focus on the\nproblem of monomorphization bloat. I will also look at options for dealing with\nmonomorphization bloat in your codebase.\n\nMonomorphization is a compilation strategy to allow polymorphism with static\ndispatch. To explain how it works, we'll look at the following function:\n\nAs you can see, this function takes in some type T. This means we can call\nthe function with any type, like so:\n\nAt compile time, the compiler sees that do_the_thing is called with three\ndifferent types: i32, f64, and &amp;str. So it creates three different\nfunctions based on do_the_thing, replacing the general T type with\neach of the three concrete types the function is actually called with. In\nthe end, you get something like this:\n\nThis is monomorphization! The generated code is equivalent to you having\nwritten three different functions, but you didn't have to actually write\nthree functions! This is really cool, as writing the general version is\na lot less work than writing a version for every concrete type you'll\nuse, and a lot more flexible too.\nBloat\nThe downside is that, by generating these functions, you potentially add\nbloat to the resulting binary. If you have a function with size n, and\nit's called with m number of concrete types, it'll have a size of\nn×m in the resulting binary! In some contexts, a large binary size can\nbe a problem.\nThankfully, there are several options to deal with this. In my last post,\nI talked about a small conversion trick using Into. This is a fairly\ncommon trick in the Rust world, and can if you're not careful cause\nthe monomorphization bloat problem we're discussing here. But imagine\nyou have something like the following:\n\nThe way monomorphization works, the entire body of the function gets copied.\nBut in the case of conversion traits like Into&lt;T&gt;, From&lt;T&gt;, AsRef&lt;T&gt;,\nBorrow&lt;T&gt;, and ToString, you can actually separate the part that needs to\nbe monomorphized from the rest of the function like so:\n\nBy splitting out the conversion code from the function, you keep the part that\nthe compiler will monomorphize, and thereby duplicate, quite small. This helps\nto keep the size of the resulting binary down.\nAlternatively, you can remove the conversion trait abstraction, and instead\nrequire callers to do the conversion themselves before calling the function.\nThis may make the API a little more tedious to use, but it avoids the potential\nproblem of bloat by not requiring monomorphization at all.\nAdditionally, you can always try to shrink the sizes of your functions by\nrefactoring. A big function is probably a sign of something gone wrong anyway.\nConclusion\nI don't say any of this to encourage you not to use trait bounds or not to\nuse some of the conversion trait niceties in your API. Generics and static\ndispatch are an important part of Rust, and it would be silly not to take\nadvantage of these features. Just keep in mind the potential for bloat, and\nkeep an eye on the size of your binary. If it grows too large and becomes a\nproblem, hopefully you will be better equipped to understand what is happening,\nand to correct it.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/monomorphization-bloat/","title":"Monomorphization Bloat"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/renegotiating-c/":{"body":"I am tying myself in a knot.\nIt all started when I read \"You (Probably) Don't Need to Learn C,\" a good article\nwhich raises good points about the poor arguments people tend to make when defending\nthe choice of learning C in this day and age. First and foremost: \"you should learn\nC so you know how a computer really works.\" The article itself refers then to David\nChisnall's \"C is Not a Low-Level Language,\" so I'll do the same because it makes the\ncase better than I can. C is not the computer. C is (maybe) the only interface to\nsyscalls exposed by the operating system, depending on the system. C is (definitely)\nan important part of computing history and computing today.\nAnd yet... \"Some Were Meant for C.\" When I was an undergraduate I had a classmate\nwho insisted on doing every assignment, regardless of the class we were taking, in C.\nThis was in a program which used C++ almost exclusively, except for the \"Software\nEngineering\" class in Java, the web development classes in the obligatory JavaScript,\nor the delightful programming languages class which covered Java, Prolog, Scheme, and...\nC.\nAnyway, this classmate insisted C was the best language, the most elegant, the one\nin which all of his ideas could be put to the machine in exactly the way he intended.\nI didn't understand it at the time, why he would think that, how he could think that.\nI toiled in the sweatshop of C++, found slight solace in Haskell code I could appreciate\nbut neither write nor understand. Eventually I found Rust, and... well... I like Rust.\nSeveral years after I graduated, I was invited back to teach that same old programming\nlanguages class after the prior professor, Dr. Richard Botting, had passed away. It was\nessentially an emergency, as the Computer Science department didn't have enough faculty to\ncover the number of sessions of the class they needed. They were hiring more, but it would\ntake time, and they needed someone fast.\nBy this point I was thoroughly Rust-brained. I'd written my fair share of Rust code, become\nthe sole Rust evangelist at work, presented at Rust Belt Rust, and written most of the\nRust Frequently Asked Questions answers. I was, through and through, a Rustacean. So\nwhen I was given the opportunity to teach a class, a class that included C in its curriculum,\nmy only question was: \"can I change the languages?\"\nI was told \"yes,\" and so I swapped out Haskell for Scheme, and Rust for C.\nThe full details of this experience became the focus of my talk at RustConf. The important\nbit is this... during the talk I made a joke: \"I replaced C with Rust, because it's 2017.\"\nGood joke. Everybody laugh. It was an easy jab at a language against which Rust was clearly\npositioned as an alternative, said to an audience all too certain to appreciate it. After all,\nwho doesn't love being told they're doing the better thing?\nHowever, in the intervening years, some context in the broader ecosystem has changed.\nFirst, a number of companies, their materials dutifully collected by Alex Gaynor\nand then reported further by Consumer Reports, started to report about the prevalence of\nmemory safety vulnerabilities in their software. The numbers break down to roughly 70%\nacross many large organizations. That's a big number!\nConsumer Reports bumping the news was also a big deal. It helped take the topic across the\nbarrier of \"things the computer nerds talk about\" and over to \"things the policy world\ntalks about.\"\nThere also started to be bigger, more noticeable cyber security events where software\nsecurity in particular was in question (not just security from the interconnection of systems\nand their surprising interactions, but literal \"the software did an oopsie with memory\"\nkinds of vulnerabilities leading to exploitation). Heartbleed, a major vulnerability in OpenSSL.\nLog4Shell, where people suddenly realized how omnipresent and hard to identify or update some\nof this software is.\nNot all of this is memory safety related, but I think the memory safety angle seems\nappealing to policymakers because it seems both achievable, and relatively clear. If someone\nsays they have a new building technique for houses that means a substantial portion of houses\nthat would fall over today wouldn't fall over in the future, you as a policy maker would\nprobably find that pretty appealing?\nSo why did memory safety suddenly feel possible? I think the answer, unintentionally,\nis Rust.\nMemory safety isn't new. Even in the latest guidance from CISA they list a number of\nnon-Rust memory safe languages, used on all sorts of widespread platforms. But crucially,\nlots of the \"big,\" \"important,\" real-world stuff is written in C or C++. They're what\nthe grown-ups use. They weren't memory safe, and there wasn't really a language which\nbundled up all the assurance guarantees you might want into a package which is easy to use.\nYeah, some people would write secure C, they'd follow the MISRA guidelines or they'd run\na bunch of analyzers or they'd hire some consultants to audit the code and give them the\nokay. At the end of the day, none of those things had the ease of what you get with a new\nlanguage that plays in the same sandbox and has memory safety right out of the gate. So\nC and C++ retained their distinction, and their cool, by existing in a little exurb\noutside of the megalopolis of memory safety, secure in the knowledge that no one could\nreally do better without them.\nRust coming along doesn't just challenge that security, it upends that security. I think\nthis is part of why Bjarne Stroustrup and the C++ Directions Group have written things\nabout security and safety that have seemed, at best, difficult to follow, and at worst\nfilled with anxiety and defensive about the essential nature and continuing compelling\npitch of C++. They haven't been at risk before! To reference an old film, \"Oh! I'm in\npain. I think this is what pain feels like.\"\nThis is not to say that either language has been resting on their laurels, or that Rust\nis set to sweep them off the stage. Despite the imagined lurking of a Rust Evangelism\nStrike Force prepared to assist C and C++ in shuffling off their mortal coils, I do\nnot think it is the expectation of technical leaders at major tech companies, nor\npolicy makers or thinktankers, to fully eliminate C and C++. There's too much of both\nlanguages around today to get rid of, and we know that replacing old code with new code\nhas a tendency to introduce new vulnerabilities anyway. In the field of a settled\ngraveyard, we must be careful digging things up.\nInstead, and you can see this borne out in the responses to the recent ONCD Request\nfor Input on open source software security, many if not most of the respondents\nrecommend a transition of new code efforts from C and C++ into memory safe languages,\nwith caution, careful prioritization, and accompanied by other assurance techniques\nwhen such a transition is not feasible or prudent, along with careful protection\nand further assurance of the C and C++ code we already have.\nNor, as I think you'll find, do the policy documents, academic papers, and thinktank\nrecommendations floating around recommend that everyone transition to Rust specifically.\nRust might be the language that helped break the dam on memory safety, but it is\nnot the only memory safe language. There are many still who recall the mess of\nAda becoming a mandatory programming language in some contexts, and who do not\nwish to repeat such an enforced monoculture.\nSo, to bring it back around, why am I in a knot? I have, through personal preference\nand a happy accident of history, invested substantial personal time and energy\ninto building my knowledge and establishing a degree of personal branding around\na programming language that is now after many years winning. Rust is winning. It's\nbeing mentioned in Congressional hearings and recommended by federal agencies.\nIt's used all over the globe. You can get real jobs in it now. Why am I troubled?\nI think we're in the middle of a grand renegotiation of what C means and\nwhat C++ means, or what they are in the context of programming, now that they're\nno longer hegemonic powers. To borrow from geopolitics a tad, this is the slow\ndecline of twin empires and the entrance of a new multipolar world. It is new,\nand different, and exciting, but also... sad?\nI think I'm in knots because I look at the people who have invested so much in C\nor C++, who now wrestle with the challenges of what this new world means for them,\nand I think that could well be me, down the line. None of us are guaranteed that we\nback the right horse in our selections of technologies to learn or \"teams\" to\ninvest in. None of us are guaranteed that we win.\nWhich brings me back to the joke, and my discomfort with it now. Back then, I wanted\nto win. I wanted to be superior; to be on the best side, with the best language.\nI wanted to be better.\nI'd like to share a video. It's of Simon Peyton Jones, a major contributor to Haskell,\nsitting with other programming language geeks at a conference years ago. In the video\nhe explains, happily, that Haskell is useless, but is slowly becoming more useful.\nIn the video, the other participants, themselves major contributors to other languages,\njump in with their own funny anecdotes and comments. When I first watched this in my\nearly 20's I thought it was kinda silly, kinda funny. What I see now is that all of\nthese people were friends. They weren't competitors; in fact they readily copy\neach other and learn from each other. In the video they talk about how Haskell\nlearned things from C#!\nIt's easy to form cliques, its easy to form monocultures. It's easy to want to win,\nand when you win it's easy to gloat.\nAs the march toward memory safety policy moves closer, I see more and more angst\nin the comments from C and C++ programmers who are fighting tooth and nail to\npreserve the best parts of the thing they love, or to defend themselves and their\nown prior choices. I see fear and concern that Rust will become the one true way\nthey will be forced to take.\nEven as we admit that C and C++'s guarantees are no longer sufficient for the\nsecurity needs of the day, given the vast important of the software systems\nwe use and maintain, I don't think we need to condemn the people who have invested\nin it, or further mock the C and C++ languages. There are good people involved in\nthem who are trying hard to improve things, and any work we do today is built on\nthe shoulders of people who came before and tried other things which may or may not\nhave worked. There wouldn't be Rust without C++, I imagine, to have paved the way\nwith many of its own design considerations and choices.\nI don't know how this transition will work out. We're in the middle of a grand\nrenegotiation whose outcome is uncertain. I'm excited to see where it goes.\nYet as I look out across the vista, and see the shore and opportunity that\nlies out of sight beyond it, as I board a ship and begin to sail, I can\nlook below me and remember, \"Some Were Meant for C\".\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/renegotiating-c/","title":"Renegotiating C"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/softlocking-apis/":{"body":"\"Softlocking\" is a term in the world of video games where a game is playable, but can't\nmake forward progress. Usually this means the game has a bug, or that the designers and\nquality assurance testers missed some combination of steps that leads to an inability\nto complete the game. It's basically a video game version of \"livelock\" failures in\nconcurrent programs, but \"softlock\" is (to me) the more fun term, so let's use it.\nThere are situations in API design where the API is softlocked into a broken design\nwhich can't be fixed. This can happen for a few reasons:\n\nThe API makes specific guarantees around what is allowed to change, and one of the\nthings that's not allowed to change would have to change to fix the issue.\nChanging the broken API would result in breaking some uses of it, and the API\nmaintainers have a policy of not breaking users.\nChanging the broken API would result in severe performance problems without much\nbroader API changes which are untenable for reasons 1 or 2.\n\nThere are some interesting examples of this in the wild, including:\n\nThe C standard can't fix the definition of intmax_t, because of how C linking\nworks and C's guarantee not to break the Application Binary Interface (ABI). You\ncan read a good explanation of this from JeanHeyd Meneide.\nPowerShell can't fix its support for .NET classes, because of specific constraints\non how PowerShell scripts are defined and executed, along with breakage issues. The\nPowerShell issue tracker shows the extensive issues still open after more than 6\nyears because of this.\n\nIn this situation, the tension basically arises between three remaining choices:\n\nBreak users by changing the known-broken API anyway.\nIntroduce a new thing that isn't broken and encourage users to migrate.\nAccept the brokenness and do your best to mitigate around the edges of it.\n\nAll of these have serious challenges associated with them.\nFirst, breaking users is a big deal. People get very upset when software that works\ntoday stops working tomorrow because something changed underneath them. Depending on\nthe scale of breakage, the required work to respond to it may also be substantial. In\nthe C case, breaking the ABI means all users of the changed API would need to recompile\ntheir code in order to link successfully, and they might not even know they need to do\nthat because the broken linked code may just silently do the wrong thing.\nBreaking users puts software projects at risk of community fracture or project abandonment,\nand should never be taken lightly.\nSecond, introducing a new API raises the question of how you tell people to move to the new\nAPI. It becomes something you have to permanently document and direct people toward. In some\ncases (looking at C again), you may also have a policy of not introducing new warnings for\npeople, so you may not even be able to mark the old broken API as deprecated to programatically\nwarn users away from it, relying solely on documentation and public communication.\nYou often also end up beholden to supporting both the old known-broken thing and the new\nthing, forever (or at least for an extended period). This burden of double maintenance\ncan be substantial and may strain the resources of the software project.\nThird, accepting the brokenness means the API remains broken, and you now have a wart\nin your system which you will still likely want to warn people to stay away from through\ndocumentation and socialization amongst software engineers. You basically decide not to\nsolve a problem because the solutions are worse. It also opens up the possibility that\nthe accumulation of unfixable problems may one day give rise to a completely different\nalternative project that is not constrained by the limits of compatibility with poor\ndecisions from the past.\nAll of this is to say that making commitments about stability and API guarantees can\nbe a fraught issue, and that even if explicit commitments aren't made, users will often\nrely on observable attributes of a design anyway, and thereby constrain you. There are\nno guarantees that you can avoid accidentally softlocking into a bad design, and\nin the end the ways out of it are shaped both by the remaining flexibility you do have\nto induce breakage, both technically and (possibly more importantly) socially.\nSystemic designs which promote modularity and interconnectedness, like the C model of\nseparately compiled object files which may be linked together, have many benefits,\nbut they also have the trade-off of locking in prior decisions in ways that can\nsubstantially constrain future improvement. Care must be taken in API design to avoid\nAPI softlocks, and more importantly to establish processes for managed evolution in\nways that mitigate pain for users while maximizing flexibility for API maintainers,\nalong with the social infrastructure for documentation and communication to manage\ntransitions. Only with those in place can you avoid the pain of API design softlocks.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/softlocking-apis/","title":"Softlocking APIs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/string-types-in-rust/":{"body":"\n\n    This was originally published on a different site.\n    This is a reproduction of a post of mine which was originally published on a\nnow-defunct programming blog called \"Suspect Semantics\". I am reproducing it\nhere to give me something to refer to, as there have been times where I wanted\nto point people to this article. I don't have any intent of bringing the\noriginal site back in full, but at least some of the content was good and is\nstill reasonably correct and relevant to be worth preserving.\n\n\nThis seems to be a common issue, so let's talk about the different string types\nin the Rust programming language. In this post I'm going to explain the\norganization of Rust's string types with String and str as\nexamples, then get into the lesser-used string types---CString,\nCStr, OsString, OsStr, PathBuf,\nand Path---and how the Cow container can make working with\nRust strings easier.\n\nThe most important thing to understand is that string types in Rust come in\npairs, which I'll call the \"owned\" variety and \"slice\" variety (the term\n\"variety\" is being used here to mean roughly \"set of types\", to make clear that\n\"owned\" and \"slice\" are not actual Rust types, but a notion of organization for\nRust's string types). The \"owned\" variety of strings---String,\nCString, OsString, and PathBuf---have\nownership over their contents (hence the name!), and can grow or shrink. The\n\"slice\" variety of strings---str, CStr, OsStr, and\nPath---are views into some collection of characters. There's also the\nCow wrapper type, which can make working with the two varieties of\nstrings easier while retaining good performance characteristics.\n\"Owned\" vs. \"Slice\" varieties of Strings\nString and str are, by far, the most common string types\nin Rust, so I will use them to illustrate the difference between the two\nvarieties of string types. String (the \"owned\" variety of string\ntype) is a wrapper for a heap-allocated buffer of UTF-8–encoded unicode\ncodepoints. str (the \"slice\" variety of string type) is a buffer of\nUTF-8–encoded unicode codepoints that may be on the heap or in the\nprogram memory itself.\nWhen you create a string literal in Rust, it is by default of type &amp;str.\nThere are two things this could mean, depending on how that buffer was\ncreated.\n\"Slice\" on the Heap\nIf the reference is taken from a String, it will be a reference to\nthe contents of the String's internal buffer, which is on the heap.\nHanding out these references is a common pattern for effectively using \"owned\"\nvariety strings in Rust. For convenience's sake, all references to \"owned\"\nvariety strings coerce to references to their \"slice\" variety equivalent. That\nis, &amp;String becomes &amp;str. It is considered good practice to use the latter\ntype for function parameters taking a reference to a string.\n\"Slice\" in Program Memory\nIf the buffer is a string literal, with or without an explicit lifetime, then\nthe buffer will be located in program memory. In fact, all string literals have\nthe 'static lifetime by default, meaning they can be safely referenced from\nanywhere in the program. Note though that having a buffer with a 'static\nlifetime is not the same as declaring a static variable. A buffer with a\n'static lifetime may be safely referenced from anywhere, but must still be\npassed to functions explicitly; it is not globally visible. A variable must be\ndeclared with the static keyword to be globally visible.\nThere is some nuance here though. When returning a &amp;str from a function, the\nlifetime of the reference must be tied to either a single input lifetime, or\na method taking either &amp;self or &amp;mut self. In the first case, the lifetime\nof the returned reference will be the lifetime of the single input reference.\nIn the second case, the lifetime will be the lifetime of the reference to\nself.\nIf your function does not fit either of these cases, rustc will return an\nerror, as in the following example:\n\nYou can avoid the lifetime elision problems entirely by explicitly annotating\nthe function in one of the following ways:\n\nSo what do you do if you want to return a string from a function without\ngiving it a 'static lifetime, or want to return a string whose contents\naren't known at compile time? You use the \"owned\" variety of string type, in\nthis case: String.\nWhy \"Owned\" Strings Exist\nThe \"owned\" varities of strings are allocated on the heap, and do not suffer the\nsame limitations of the \"slice\" varities. They may be freely moved around\nwithout safety issues, handing out slices of their internal buffer as needed.\nThe \"slice\" varities do not have the same guarantees, and so can't be used as\nfreely.\nIf you want to avoid dealing with ownership and borrowing for strings, you\ncan just turn every \"slice\" variety into an \"owned\" variety via the\nto_owned() method (provided by the ToOwned trait,\nwhich all \"owned\" varities of string types implement), and only work with the\n\"owned\" varities, but doing so would incur performance penalties when you\nunecessarily allocate string buffers on the heap, and would be considered poor\nRust style. Instead, it's best to develop an understanding of when the two\nvarities of strings are needed.\nAnother important thing to note is that because the \"owned\" varities of strings\nabstract away the underlying buffer, they can grow or shrink, possibly\nallocating a new underlying buffer and copying their contents to this new\nbuffer. The \"slice\" varities of strings cannot be resized, as they may not even\nbe on the heap.\nThe \"slice\" variety strings can only be accessed via what's called a \"fat\npointer.\" This is because slices are \"dynamically-sized types,\" meaning they\ndo not carry information about their own length. They are simply some\ncollection of contiguous memory. A \"fat pointer\" to a slice stores both a\npointer to the memory in question and the length of the data stored at that\nmemory location. This is all handled automatically by Rust, but it means that\nthe \"slice\" variety of strings are interacted with via references, rather than\nbeing handled directly. For more detail about dynamically-sized types, check\nout \"The&nbsp;Rustonomicon,\" which covers them in detail.\nThe String Type Pairs\nThe pairs of string types are differentiated from each other by the guarantees\nprovided by the underlying buffer.\nString and str\n: String and str are guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 encoded\nUnicode strings. If you're wondering why UTF-8 is the standard encoding for\nRust strings, check out the Rust FAQ's answer to that question.\nCString and CStr\n: CString and CStr are guaranteed to be compatible with C\nstrings, and are usually used in FFI code.\nOsString and OsStr\n: OsString and OsStr are guaranteed to be\nplatform-native strings (that is, they use the encoding of the current\nplatform) that can be cheaply converted into String and\nstr types. They are usually used when interacting directly with the\noperating system.\nPathBuf and Path\n: PathBuf and Path are wrappers around\nOsString and OsStr that provide convenient methods\nfor operating on paths according to the rules of the current system. They are\nusually used when interacting with system paths.\nCow\nThere are times when working with strings in Rust that you want to cleanly\nabstract over the two varities of string types. Maybe you want a container that\nmay hold either \"owned\" variety or \"slice\" variety strings, or you want to use\nslices except for cases where an \"owned\" variety is absolutely necessary. In\nthese situations, use Cow.\nCow (which stands for \"Clone on Write\") is a container that can take in\na \"slice\" variety of string type, and only convert that \"slice\" variety into an\n\"owned\" variety when absolutely necessary (when something attempts to write to\nthe slice). This has the advantage of reducing the complexity of reasoning about\nownership, while also helping keep unecessary allocations down. It is not a\npanacea, but it can be very helpful sometimes.\nConclusion\nThat was a relatively quick explanation of string types in Rust. Hopefully that\nhelped to clarify a bit of why the different string types exist, and why they\nare useful.

The original thread can be found at Twitter.\nThe version reproduced here is done without the thread-markers, @-references,\nand hashtags which were used in the original.\n\n\nSo Steve Klabnik posted a really thoughtful piece on open source and free software\n(read it if you haven't),\nand the responses on places like Hacker News made an error that seems common in these\ncircles: believing working harder will solve a problem.\nThis comes up with people defending C, who argue \"people should write better C.\" Of\ncourse, this is nonsense. If a person can write better C consistently, we should\nassume they will. If a person can, with extreme focus, write better C, that doesn't\nmean they can sustain it.\nIt comes up with free software too. When someone points out the failures of the free\nsoftware movement, the response is \"more people should believe in free software,\nTHEN we can deliver our goals.\" This is nonsense. You don't get more adherents by\ndemanding more adherents.\nIn both scenarios, people refuse to re-examine structures. It's not that C isn't\nmeeting our needs, it's that we're not good enough to meet them ourselves. It's not\nthat free software isn't achieving its goals, it's that not enough people believe in\nit for it to succeed.\nThis is all tied to the underlying politics of the software developers, often\ncharacterized as \"technolibertarian,\" which believes strongly in the goodness of\ntechnology, and the primacy of the individual in determining outcomes.\nThis ideology is diametrically opposed to the structuralist view the Steve appears to\nbe taking in his piece, or that tech critics are often taking in their critiques of\ntech. It plays out in the thousand externalities of tech which go unaddressed.\nWhat's frustrating about this ideology is it opposes resolution of structural problems,\nagainst mounting evidence of their existence and the failure of existing solutions to\nfix them. It also connects to a point about programming languages as political objects.\nSteve's a leader in the Rust community, and that's no accident. Rust is a structural\nresponse to C. Where a technolibertarian says \"write better C,\" a Rustacean says\n\"write Rust, which changes the structure so it, and not you, carries the burden of\ncorrectness.\"\nThis is not a small point. It's a microcosm of the fact that the technologies we build\nare manifestations of our politics. It is not possible to keep politics out of tech,\nbecause our politics shape how we approach problems, and what we build to fix them.\nWe have, as I see it, two competing cultures in tech. The dominant culture,\ntechnolibertarianism, and the counter-culture, which I'll call technostructuralism.\nThese two cultures are often talking past each other, but they're building systems\nthat match their perspectives.\nI know which side I prefer. Hopefully (maybe with a name, mine or someone else's)\nthe technostructuralists can come out of the closet and unify their technology with\ntheir politics. At the very least, let's move the conversation.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technostructuralism/","title":"Technostructuralism"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/the-xz-backdoor/":{"body":"Another big security event happened.\nThis time, it’s that the “xz” project was backdoored. The full details\nand impact of the attack are still being understood, with Linux distros\nand other systems that have integrated the malicious code now raising\ntheir antibodies and responding. This will continue as we figure out the scope,\nand secondary impacts and recommended next steps like rotating SSH keys and\ndetecting if individual systems have been compromised will no doubt come as\nwell.\nWhen big security events like this happen, people often quickly try to identify\ncauses, and (more importantly) fixes to make sure it doesn’t happen again.\nOften, individuals are working on systems, tools, or standards which are in\nsome way relevant, and rush to explain how their preferred solution is actually\nthe right solution for this exact thing. People may also look for how this new\nstory validates their prior beliefs about systemic problems, like\nunderinvestment in security or poor support for open source software\nmaintainers.\nOf course, security is in many ways like any other complex system failure, and\ncomplex systems do not fail for one reason. They fail for many reasons, and\nthey generally operate in states of partial failure at all times. This means\nthere is no one cause, and no one solution. It also means ideas for single\nsolutions generally end up being reductive, and arguments collapse into ideas\nfor singular fix-alls, followed by nitpicking about all the little cases that\naren’t solved. Little progress ends up being made.\nIn this situation, it’s likely there are many things we could do to make the\ncomplex system of open source software more secure and resilient to this kind\nof failure. Some solutions may not themselves fix immediate problems, but might\nmake other solutions more viable by standardizing or simplifying processes in\nways that enable automated detection.\nSBOMs, reproducible builds, trusted builds in CI, provenance attestations are\nall things that exist in this general space of making the supply chain more\nintelligible, especially for automated analysis.\nOn the human side, we have issues like supporting projects financially to\navoid burnout in maintainers, identifying and raising alarms for deeper\nauditing when maintainers change on trusted open source projects, continuing\ninvestment in analysis and improvement to “critical” open source projects\nlike “xz” which are incorporated widely.\nI won’t pretend to have a silver bullet for this situation, and if anyone\nelse IS pretending they’ve found the solution, they’re likely selling you\nsomething. Especially when the software community is still hard at work\nreconstructing the timeline of factual events and understanding the scope\nof the impact, it’s too soon to say what all the fixes or systemic\nimprovements would be. As for counterfactual claims of what “would have”\navoided it, these are slippery swords in the best of times.\nAt the end of the day, I think we’re best off slowing down on speculation,\nfocusing on the facts of what happened, what the impact is, and how to\nrespond to it to mitigate risk and harden systems. As we learn more, we\ncan also prompt useful discussions of systemic change for better security,\nespecially where we can enable better scalable discovery or prevention, or\nraise auditing alarms earlier. All with the recognition that there is no\none cause, and no single solution.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/the-xz-backdoor/","title":"The “xz” Backdoor"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":85,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":11,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/implementation-selection/":{"body":594,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/monomorphization-bloat/":{"body":297,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/renegotiating-c/":{"body":1022,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/softlocking-apis/":{"body":450,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/string-types-in-rust/":{"body":806,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technostructuralism/":{"body":293,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/the-xz-backdoor/":{"body":310,"title":2}},"length":9},"lang":"English"}
